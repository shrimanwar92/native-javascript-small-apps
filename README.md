# native-javascript-small-apps

This repo contains my attempt to create small apps natively(only vanilla js, no frameworks) for deep learning.

I have used various standard features

1) Used flexbox for creating various layouts

2) Used debouncing for keyup searches

3) Manipulating tables using plain js.

4) Use ES6 as well as template literal syntax for creating dynamic html instead of traditional approach.

4) Usage of web-components for creating reusable code.
